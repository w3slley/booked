Features implemented:
	1)Made the transition to PDO in the backend. This is something I planned to do a long time ago but never had the time and patience to do it.

I still have to fix the front end because I messed around with the month tag in the nav bar and still have to fix that. What I did today was transition everything I had coded to PDO. There's a lot of things to do though. The web app is the same but with the new backend.

Feature implemented:
	1) Used the goodreads api to improve the python script which downloads bookcovers. Now users can download even bookcovers from portuguese books. There're some issues I have to work on though.

24/02/2019
Features implemented:
	1) Fixed the display of the months to select at the initial page.
	2) Made sure that the book title will be deleted from database and the bookcover from the images folder when there's no other user who has the book added to their list. This will save storage space.
	3) Messed around with the python script. First I tried to get the book id via the API, but I don't know if this is going to work. Then, I tried to get all the links of the bookcovers and display them in the webpage. The user could choose the right one. I don't know if that's going to work out either.

I'm back - again - to implement some new features in the booked web app:
	1) Changed again the python script to use googletrans and make search using google.
Now it's runing as it use to (some error had occur with googletrans but now it's working fine). I have to implement some javascript features in the future.

1)Today I started to change the way the url looks like. There were a lot of blank atributes in the url and I changed that. Now only the year will appear when the user wants to see all the books read in that year. Likewise, only the year and the month will be displayed in the url when the user wants to see the books read in that month of the year.
2)fixed date format in the books component.
3)Fixed the url of the searches (before the submit= appeared and now it doesn't).
4) Fixed problem with select tag in the editing section. Now the month the user read the book will appear in the select tag.
5) Fixed a problem I had with the years displayed. The problem was that they didn't have space between them and they were treated as one single word. I just inserted a space and it became the way I wanted.
6) Made sure that when any reading event is excluded, if the author or book aren't being use in any other, they are excluded from the database. This will save space and storage in the DB. I only need to implement this for the years. Tomorrow I'll try to do it.


25/06/2019
1)Implemented item 6) for the years.
2)Fixed problem I was having while deleting reading events.
3)Fixed font-family in the navbar select.
4)Fixed position of text inside the box div. Now they are floated insted of being manually assign a position (like it was before).
5)Fixed problem reguarding the animation in and out of the buttons in the box of the reading event.
6)Created a section in the dashboard that displays the last book added in the system. I also added the total number of books added in the databases.
7)Changed the way the books are displayed. Before they were shown from december on the top to january on the bottom. Now it's the oposite.
8)Implemented feature that displays the number of books read in the current month.

28/06/2019
1)Create a partial classification system. I need to implement the backend so that the user can add a grade to the book while adding it to the system.

30/06/2019
1)Users can now update the value of the classification in the edit section.
2)Inserted all the functions in the edit.php file in the bookEvent.php file. They are now all inside the class and are responsible for updating the information on the books and book reading event.
3)Created a modal to add new books. The input tags are all in there. I still have to create a modal to edit the books using ajax.
4)Created a modal where users can edit it the books. Right now it doen't work async, but it will soon.

01/07/2019
1)Created the front-end of the index page. There's a lot of things to do yet, but it's kind of nice. I have to create the front end for mobile.
2)Created the front-end for the login page.
3)Started to arrange things in the dashboar for a brand new user.

I'm back at the development of the web app. I need to implement some features:
1)Use PDO in the interaction with the mysql database (DONE).
2)Display categories and months when adding a new book to DB. Give the users the option to choose a category from the db or to add a new one. The same thing could work with the years. (DONE with months)
3)Do it also in the edit section (DONE with months)
4)Implement AJAX calls on the entire website.
5)Create the front end of the index page.
6)Create the front end of the profile page.
7)Make sure when the user delete one book and it's the only one read in that particular year, then the user has to be redirected to another page - and not the page of the excluded year (DONE).
8)Add a last added book in the dashboard. (DONE)
9)Add a counter of how many books the user read in total. (DONE)
10)Add a loading animation when the user downloads the bookcover in the edit section.
11)When solving the mechanisms of the delete function, I acidentally programed the logic to go to the last year the user has regardless of what book the user deleted... I have to fix this ASAP. (DONE)
12) Solve problem with delete funcionality (DONE)
13) Create section where users can add comments and classification on the books.
14) Need to make the classification unique for each user. Right now it's enbeded in the books table. I have to add another column in the add_book table with the name 'classification' or 'grade'.
15) Add error handlers in the grade part of the modal. I need to make sure that the user can only insert a number from 0 to 100.
16) I need to fix the problem with the years in the edit section. When you alter the year on it, it doesn't happen. I need to make sure that when a new year is inserted there, it needs the be created in the DB (if it doesn't exist yet) and redirected to there.
17)Finish the editing section using AJAX.
18)Create a design for the editing section.
19)Don't forget to fix the security problem in the edit section. Right now, I can edit anyone's books if I know the add_book_id. I need to make sure that only the user that added the book can access it.
